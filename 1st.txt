1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL commands are used to define or modify database structures, such as tables, schemas, and indexes.

CREATE: Creates a new table, database, view, or index.

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    position VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
ALTER: Modifies an existing database structure, like a table (to add, modify, or delete columns).

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN hire_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN salary DECIMAL(12, 2);
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN position;
DROP: Deletes a table, view, or database permanently.

sql
Copy code
DROP TABLE employees;
DROP DATABASE my_database;
TRUNCATE: Deletes all rows from a table without deleting the table itself.

sql
Copy code
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DML commands are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from tables.

INSERT: Adds new rows of data into a table.

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, position, salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Manager', 5000.00);
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.

sql
Copy code
UPDATE employees SET salary = 5500.00 WHERE id = 1;
DELETE: Removes rows from a table based on a condition.

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 3000.00;
3. DCL (Data Control Language)
DCL commands are used to manage access and permissions in a database.

GRANT: Gives specific privileges to users or roles.

sql
Copy code
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON my_database.employees TO 'username'@'localhost';
REVOKE: Removes specific privileges from users or roles.

sql
Copy code
REVOKE INSERT ON my_database.employees FROM 'username'@'localhost';
4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL commands are used to manage transactions, ensuring that a series of DML operations succeed or fail as a group.

BEGIN TRANSACTION / START TRANSACTION: Begins a new transaction.

sql
Copy code
START TRANSACTION;
COMMIT: Saves the changes made during the transaction to the database permanently.

sql
Copy code
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK: Undoes changes made during the transaction, reverting the database to its previous state.

sql
Copy code
ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

sql
Copy code
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
RELEASE SAVEPOINT: Removes a previously defined savepoint.

sql
Copy code
RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
